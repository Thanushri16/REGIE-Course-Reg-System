README for Practicum 2 Deliverable 3:

1. The "/sql" folder consists the .sql files to create and populate the database. Run these database_creation.sql and database_values_insertion.sql values files first to populate the database before running the tests. Running the tests without setting up the database would result in the tests failing. The name of the database is "course_registration".
2. The "/python" folder consists of the .py files that has the classes as well as the tests. The tests can be executed by running a "pytest" in the terminal of the python project folder. If the database is set up correctly, all test cases should necessarily pass. Entire user management and 50% of my course registration system is integrated with MySQL. Rest of the course registration system functionalities will be implemented in the upcoming project iterations.
